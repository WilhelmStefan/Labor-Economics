# Project in Labor Economics

## Summary
In their paper "Welfare, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and the Labor Supply of Single Mothers" Bruce D. Meyer and Dan T. Rosenbaum (2001) state that tax and welfare reforms between 1984 and 1996 increased labor supply of single mothers by 6-9%. They used childless single women who were not affected by the reforms as the reference group in a difference-in-difference approach to identify these effects. Based on their finding this projects examines the effects of the subsequent welfare reform on the very same groups. The project provides evidence that the newly introduced TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) stopped the converging trend of unemployment rates of single mothers and single women. Moreover, it is shown that the TANF benefits have merely a minimal impact on the probability of a single women beeing employed.
